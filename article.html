            <h3>First news: </h3>
            <p>
                On China's railway projectChina has recently started a new railway line which will pass through China to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Through this railway line, China has started increasing its influence in these Central Asian countries. This region serves as a strategic route between Europe and Asia and opens the way for direct supply of energy resources to China. This can be a matter of concern for India, as India imports energy products from these countries. In future, this railway line can also be extended to Azerbaijan and Iran.</p>
            <h3>Second news:</h3>
            <p>   
                Changing equations with Russia and AmericaIndia has reduced coal imports from Russia by 22% in the last three months, while imports from the US have increased by 14%. Transportation costs have increased due to sanctions on Russia and Russian coal is not able to compete in the Indian market. On the other hand, the Indian energy sector is benefiting from the cheaper coal from the US. Apart from this, Russia has started a new road and rail route to supply coal to India, named International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC).
